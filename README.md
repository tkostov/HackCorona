## Our solution

#### Visualize the corona-outbreak in our area, region or country and simulate its spread in the nearest futures. Help corona crisis teams identify future shortages such as ICUs & remedial actions.

[Live demo](http://track-the-virus-v3.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com)

* Fetching COVID19 infection and hospitality data from several institutions such as RKI
* Storing the data in a MongoDB
* Backend handling data and requests implemented with Flask.
* Simulation with SEIR (in production) and several other models such as a Progressive State Model and a Latent Variable Model. 

#### Please note that our predictions are based on sophisticated mathematical models and aim to give insights about possible resource shortages and crisis areas. We do not, by any means, guarantee that our predictions provide any reliability.
